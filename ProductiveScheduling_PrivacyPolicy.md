## Productive Scheduling: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Productive Scheduling app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Andrew Caris. The app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

### Explanation of personally identifiable information requested in the app
To use the app a user needs to register with an email address. The data created/stored by the app is tied to this user account across IOS/Android/Web platforms. The user may delete all data from within the app and their stored credentials.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Andrew Caris
